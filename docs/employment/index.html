        I'm Rob, a Wellington New Zealand based web-developer and sysadmin who works for domain-name registrar <a href="https://iwantmyname.com">iwantmyname</a>. I’m currently look for work, so if this sounds like someone who'd be a good fit for your team please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.

      I have experience in both product-development, contracting, and research environments, and my current role is part of a remote-first team. I love friendly, social workplaces, and the opportunity to learn new things. Over the years I've programmed in a range of languages, with extensive experience in Ruby on Rails, and most recently Elixir and Phoenix. Lately I’ve been focusing on improving my operations and system-administration skills, and I have an interest in UX and design. My preference is for the best language/tool for the job, rather than the newest hotness, and for spaces over tabs. I really enjoy the way web-development involves a broad range of subjects, with everything from the highly technical to the firmly user-centric.

      In my spare time I love to attend gigs and <a href="https://www.djrube.com">DJ around Wellington</a> (if you'd like a long conversation, ask me about Drum and Bass or New Orleans marching band music). I'm a regular at the local Burning Man event Kiwiburn, and I love to travel.
