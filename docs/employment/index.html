        I'm Rob, a Wellington New Zealand based web-developer and sysadmin who works for domain-name registrar <a href="https://iwantmyname.com">iwantmyname</a>. I’m currently look for work, so if this sounds like someone that might be a good fit for your team <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      I have experience in both product-development, contracting, and research environments, with my current job being a “remote-first” one. I love friendly, social teams, and the opportunity to learn new things. Having programmed in a range of languages over the years, I have extensive experience with Ruby on Rails, and have worked most recently with Elixir and Phoenix, but my focus is always whatever is the best tool to get the job done. Lately I’ve been focused on improving my operations and system-administration skills. I have an interest in UX and Design, and enjoy the broad range of subjects web-development involves, from the highly technical to the highly people based. You can find my <a href="https://github.com/robramsaynz">github here</a>.

        In my spare time I love to attend gigs, and DJ around Wellingtion. If you'd like a very long conversation, ask me about Drum and Bass, or marching band music from New Orleans. I'm a regular at the local burning man event Kiwiburn, and I love to travel.
