        I'm an intermediate level Rails developer, with a masters in Engineering and a research-background in electronics and software. I switched to web development four years ago for the interesting work and user centric projects. I enjoy learning new tools, and look to use processes like testing, refactoring, and code review to improve the code I write. I'm used to working in interdisciplinary teams, and interacting directly with clients.
