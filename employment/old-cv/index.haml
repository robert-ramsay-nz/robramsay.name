      %ul
        %li
          %b Volcanic Simulation Website:
          created for the University of
          Canterbury's Geology dept., this website simulates volcanic eruptions using
          animated 2D-graphs and narrative text. JavaScript is used to create a moving
          simulation-timeline the user can control, and to update the siteâ€™s graphs and
          dynamic components. PHP software allows an admin-user to update the simulation
          data, which is filtered and stored in an SQL database. A freelance project, I
          interviewed the client, created the site-specification, and individually coded
          the HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript components. This also involved Linux server
          admin, and Apache and MySQL software configuration.
        %li
          %b www.torokiki.net:
          a web-based ethnographic role-playing game,
          where users create text, picture, or video responses to curated images of
          historic Wellington. Central to this game is group play and motivational
          quests. The site was a personal collaboration between members of HITLab NZ and
          Wellington's web community. I helped create the site's concept design and
          storyboards, and was responsible for designing and creating its custom
          email-gateway for content submission. This parses mail from users, extracts
          content, and transmits it to the web-site, before sending a user reply.
          Torokiki was presented at the
          %b 2010 Webstock Mix and Mash
          conference.
        %li
          %b Academic Teaching Support:
          technical support provision for an
          Augmented Reality course (HITLab). Including: preparation of course tools,
          in-class lectures, and maintaining a website with detailed help documentation.
          Responsible for: copy and files for site, configuration of Apache web-server,
          and administration of Linux server. The server also provided password
          protected repositories for the Git source-code management system, allowing
          researchers to collaborate on multiple projects.
        %li
          %b ARToolkit Port:
          port of the ARToolkit augmented-reality library,
          for the ARM embedded-processor common in cell phones (HITLab). Collaborated
          with Finnish research lab creating augmented reality application, combining
          this library with a broad range of image processing such as QR-code reading, and
          facial recognition. Involved self-taught programming of mobile 3D-graphics, and
          extensive work with embedded-Linux platforms and mobile phones.
